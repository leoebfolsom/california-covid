### California Covid Analytics

This project will transform data from [the State of California's COVID-19 Datasets](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZ1MBZAUJF?search=california) from Snowflake Marketplace.


### What do we want to learn from this data?

I will figure that out as I get a bit more familiar with the data, but initially I would like to explore trends in PPE orders by zip code.
